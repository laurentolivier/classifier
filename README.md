Classifier
==========

Classifier addons modules for OpenErp / Odoo

Usage:
------
- Create a classifier with categories (eg :Classsfier "Language" with categories : english, french, german,...)
- Train each category with sample texts
- Select attachments/documents with indexed content and make the classifier "guess" their category.

Notes:
-----
- The classfier uses a naive bayesian.
- Many functions of it come from Oreilly http://examples.oreilly.com/9780596529321/.
